English--Portuguese
===================

These are the linguistic data for the Apertium English--Portuguese
machine translator.  This data is currently under development.  You
need apertium-3.0 and lttoolbox-3.0 to use this translator.

To compile the linguistic data simply do:

    $ ./configure

to generate a Makefile file and then

    $ make

inside of this directory.  To compile directly from Subversion run

    $ ./autogen.sh

first.
